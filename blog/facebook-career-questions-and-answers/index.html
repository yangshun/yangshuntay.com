Recruiters will reach out to you if there&#x27;s interest and chat with you over the phone. If it goes well, there will be two rounds of coding interviews.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-are-some-qualitiesexperiences-that-facebook-looks-for-in-a-resume">What are some qualities/experiences that Facebook looks for in a resume?<a class="hash-link" href="#what-are-some-qualitiesexperiences-that-facebook-looks-for-in-a-resume" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>IANAR and I don&#x27;t filter any resumes, so I don&#x27;t exactly know. But from experience, write stuff that makes you stand out from the rest. Have good grades? Add it in. Scholarships/awards, write them down. Have extensive internship experience? Include them in an organized format. Built cool hacks/side projects? Add the GitHub links and demos. Won hackathons/competitions? Put them in. One thing is for sure - few companies would want to hire candidates who only have academic credentials and no industry experience.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="does-gpa-affect-a-lot-on-the-resume-screening">Does GPA affect a lot on the resume screening?<a class="hash-link" href="#does-gpa-affect-a-lot-on-the-resume-screening" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>GPA/CAP/grades is just one of the signals that can be extracted from the resume. As mentioned above, there are many other qualities and achievements a candidate can possess. Personally if I had my own company, I would rather hire a candidate with a high second upper and fantastic open source portfolio with multiple internship experiences at big companies over a student with CAP 5.00 but has nothing else to show for. Not that one candidate is stronger than the other, but the former would probably be a safer choice.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="in-general-hows-the-barrier-of-entry-for-big-tech-companies-like-fb-in-terms-of-grades-would-a-second-lower-35-39-even-get-pass-the-resume-screening-stage">In general, how&#x27;s the barrier of entry for big tech companies like FB in terms of grades, would a second lower (3.5-3.9) even get pass the resume screening stage?<a class="hash-link" href="#in-general-hows-the-barrier-of-entry-for-big-tech-companies-like-fb-in-terms-of-grades-would-a-second-lower-35-39-even-get-pass-the-resume-screening-stage" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Grades matter less the longer someone has left school. For students, because there&#x27;s a lack of working experience, grades might play a larger part in the resume screening, but it&#x27;s by no means the only thing that matters.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="is-the-resume-screening-done-by-ai--human-recruiter-what-is-being-looked-out-for-on-the-resume-as-someone-who-isnt-strong-academically-will-i-be-able-to-compete-purely-based-on-experience-on-my-resume">Is the resume screening done by AI / human recruiter?

Usually people suck at their studies because instead of studying they spent their time elsewhere. If it was spent on related stuff like hacking on side projects and internships, that probably makes up for the subpar academic grades. But if you suck at studies and spent your time clubbing instead, then I&#x27;m sorry you probably won&#x27;t get past the screening. Note that CS is such a hot course now that only the best students can get in these days. A fair amount of students have both good grades AND non-academic achievements. Competition is tough!</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="are-there-any-languagesframeworks-that-are-helpful-to-know-before-applying">Are there any languages/frameworks that are helpful to know before applying?<a class="hash-link" href="#are-there-any-languagesframeworks-that-are-helpful-to-know-before-applying" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>For Software Engineering (SWE) positions, Facebook doesn&#x27;t require you to have experience in specific languages/frameworks before joining. Likewise, there aren&#x27;t any of such restrictions for SWE interviews. You can do your interviews in your programming language of choice. One exception to this is if you&#x27;re applying for a Front End Engineer or Mobile Engineer position, then you will be asked domain-specific questions and by extension, required to use JavaScript/Java/Kotlin/Objective-C/Swift to answer the questions.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="are-intern-applications-and-hence-the-spots-based-on-first-come-first-served">Are intern applications (and hence, the spots) based on first-come-first-served?<a class="hash-link" href="#are-intern-applications-and-hence-the-spots-based-on-first-come-first-served" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>IANAR. But as with all jobs, there are definitely limited spots and once they&#x27;re filled up there isn&#x27;t a need to hire anymore. Applying in 2022 for the internship which application opens in September, is almost definitely too late. You can apply later (October) if you want more time to prepare, but there might be fewer slots left. Moral of the story - prepare early.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="hows-the-referral-process-aboutlike">How&#x27;s the referral process about/like?<a class="hash-link" href="#hows-the-referral-process-aboutlike" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Facebook will send you a form (initiated by me) where you can fill up your name, email, upload your resume, and select the roles you would like to apply. From there on, from an applicant perspective it&#x27;s not different from them applying themselves on the Facebook Careers Portal.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="may-i-know-until-when-your-referral-is-valid-i-was-hoping-to-start-my-application-a-bit-later-so-was-hoping-to-reach-out-to-you-then-for-a-referral-is-there-any-last-date-to-claim-this-in-any-way">May I know until when your referral is valid?

As mentioned earlier, if you apply when unprepared, you risk wasting the chance. Take too long and apply too late, then you risk the slots being all filled up. I don&#x27;t know the last date to be referred but I recommend not later than end of September.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="any-tips-for-a-good-resume-to-apply-for-fb">Any tips for a good resume to apply for FB?<a class="hash-link" href="#any-tips-for-a-good-resume-to-apply-for-fb" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Answered above. I don&#x27;t think most students need to worry about the resume screening stage. Worry about the interviews. Use a neat and standard template and you should be fine.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="if-i-build-my-projects-must-some-of-them-be-pushed-to-production-before-applying">If I build my projects must some of them be pushed to production before applying?<a class="hash-link" href="#if-i-build-my-projects-must-some-of-them-be-pushed-to-production-before-applying" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Best if you can, but I&#x27;m not sure if recruiters actually click on your project links.

Typically you will only be interviewed for one location. Candidates based in Singapore are free to apply to non-Singapore positions and intern there.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-the-application-process-like-for-the-software-engineer-role-is-it-any-different-from-the-enterprise-and-front-end-engineer-role">What is the application process like for the Software Engineer role?

I&#x27;m not sure about Enterprise Engineers, I suspect it wouldn&#x27;t be too different. For Front End Engineers, the questions will be domain-specific, hence will require candidates to write HTML/CSS/JavaScript. Note that Facebook Singapore currently does not hire Front End Engineers and interns.

General tip for coding interviews - focus on the most common data structures and algorithms. If a particular topic is really obscure, most likely you won&#x27;t be asked on it because asking obscure stuff sometimes work against the interviewers as it&#x27;d be harder for them to extract the right signals out of it.

They will be assigned an Intern Manager that would serve as their mentor throughout the internship. The mentor is typically the one who came up with the project which is broken down into multiple milestones. Responsibilities of an intern manager include: onboarding the intern, giving the intern regular feedback on how they are doing, reviewing their code (typically together with other members of the team), evaluating whether the intern will get a return offer.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="hows-the-mentorship-like-for-fb-interns-do-a-mentor-work-together-with-intern-on-the-same-project-are-mentors-randomly-assigned-within-the-company-or-do-they-volunteer-for-it">How&#x27;s the mentorship like for FB interns?

Employees can sign up to be an intern manager for a specific internship season. It is not random.

For FTEs, much more autonomy.</p><p>Longer answer: Interns are assigned a project which usually have a pre-defined tech stack. So the engineering work and stack that an intern will be doing is highly dependent on the assigned team and project. If the intern finishes the work early, it&#x27;s possible to ask for more work from their manager and possibly try out other things. If the internship duration coincides with one of the internal hackathons, interns can participate in them and work on anything they want. For SWEs, there&#x27;s a process called bootcamp after joining where employees find their own team to join. That gives them more flexibility in deciding what kind of work they want to do. Internal mobility is very good within FB as well. Personally I&#x27;ve done both front end and back end at Facebook.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="fb-culture">FB Culture<a class="hash-link" href="#fb-culture" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="whats-the-difference-between-software-engineer-swe-enterprise-engineer-ee-and-front-end-engineer-this-is-because-i-heard-from-previous-fb-interns-that-they-worked-on-the-full-stack">What&#x27;s the difference between Software Engineer (SWE), Enterprise Engineer (EE), and Front End Engineer?

Perhaps you meant SF Bay Area. Anyway, FB SG and FB US differ is quite a lot of ways. There are too many to list but I&#x27;ll list the most obvious ones.</p><ul><li>Career Progression - FB US, being the HQ and where the company started, has the most number of teams and you have all levels of seniority of folks there. In FB SG, there are fewer teams and due to the size of the office now, there isn&#x27;t a need for extremely senior engineers yet. So if you&#x27;re talking about long term career progression, SG definitely loses out here. But don&#x27;t need to think so far la, FB SG is still big enough for you to get to senior engineer position and earn enough to live comfortably for the rest of your life.</li><li>Projects - Primarily product teams and hires primarily SWEs and EEs, while FB US has a good mix of teams, including infrastructure teams and hires across all roles. So if you&#x27;re interested in working on infra stuff like our internal logging framework, GraphQL, our internal ORM, you&#x27;d have to look at non-SG offices.</li><li>Changing Teams - SG has fewer teams, so if you were looking to change teams but remain in Singapore, the choices are more limited.</li><li>Company Culture - You don&#x27;t get to attend the events held only at the HQ in-person, such as Zuck&#x27;s Q&amp;A or company town halls or the summer and holiday parties (but there are local versions of them).</li><li>Food - Smaller selection of cafes. Food is still pretty darn good though. There&#x27;s nothing to complain about free food.</li><li>Office - Smaller office in SG, but still one of the coolest in SG. Menlo Park Headquarters is amazing, there&#x27;s an arcade, board games room, a barber, ice cream shop, a gadgets vending machine, and more. It looks like Universal Studios at night. I&#x27;ll just leave this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cY3sMN3wohg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a> here.</li><li>$$$ - FB pay is top tier in both US and SG. However in SG, you have to pay less tax and cheaper living expenses. In SG, I earn less but save more due to the large difference in taxes.</li><li>Taxes - SG tax is crazy low compared to US. US taxes you on every damn thing, including the capital gains from your stocks and bank interest earned (WTF), but SG doesn&#x27;t.</li><li>Engineering Culture - Similar-ish because quite a number of engineers in FB SG moved here from FB US, including myself. But being a smaller office, we don&#x27;t have extremely senior engineers (no principal and higher).</li><li>Social Security - I thought Bay Area was relatively safer than the smaller US states, but these days <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ybiHCxNb3w" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">driving on the highway also can get shot</a>, so I don&#x27;t know anymore. I think SG is definitely safer, at least you definitely won&#x27;t kena any racist remarks or comments while walking on the streets.</li><li>Personal Happiness - Obviously you&#x27;d have fewer friends and family if you&#x27;re in the US. If that&#x27;s important to you then life there might be hard. But you can make new angmoh friends or hang out with the steadily growing SG community over there.</li><li>Dating Scene - If you&#x27;re single, it might be hard to find a long-term partner there. The female Singaporean engineers there are mostly taken, those that are not, probably want to stay single. Dating there will be quite hard! I know of friends who got together with Americans/immigrants and then they get a green card and plan to stay there for good. You can consider that too.</li></ul><p>I would describe myself as a small fish in a big pond when I was in FB US and am now a big fish in a smaller pond in FB SG.

If we were to hire only people who have prior experience with them, then we&#x27;d have a really hard time filling our head count.</p><p>When tech companies hire SWEs, usually it&#x27;s for a generalist position and they would expect the employees to pick up any new language or tool to get the job down. If you master your fundamentals, doing that shouldn&#x27;t be too hard. So really most companies would want to hire people who can learn fast and adapt. The exception is if you&#x27;re a super senior person (think principal level and above), then you&#x27;d be hired for your specialized skillsets probably because the company needs some subject-matter expert in that area. But most of you are still undergrads, that doesn&#x27;t apply to you.</p><p>At the end of the day, many language and tools are similar-ish. New technologies learn from existing technologies and improve on them, learning new technologies isn&#x27;t always that foreign.</p><p>However, to be a good SWE, I would recommend peeking beneath the abstraction layers and understanding what problem this technology is trying to solve, how it works under the hood, and what advantages/disadvantages it has compared to similar technologies. That&#x27;s why I love Open Source, all the code is public - you can read the code, look at how the projects are structured, and even contribute to them. I also love reading articles comparing technologies so that I know what tradeoffs the projects are making and what&#x27;s the right tool for the job. Don&#x27;t be a mindless drone who uses technologies without knowing why you are using it instead of alternatives.

That&#x27;s why I chose to do client side engineering. As to why the web, I like the fast iteration and release cycle of building on web platforms. My first hardcore CS course was actually CS3217 (I only took CS1010E and CS1020E prior to that), so the first proper software I wrote was on iOS platform. Developing on mobile is too troublesome for my liking, because I often need a physical device, compiling the app takes so long, and you have to play by the platform&#x27;s rules. They could take down your app anytime they want. On the other hand, the web is much more open and anyone can launch any website they want in a matter of hours. Being able to show people what I built by giving them a URL is an exciting experience that never gets old.</p><p>I haven&#x27;t worked at Google so I can&#x27;t comment on workload at Google. But Google is known as a good company to &quot;rest and vest&quot; whereas Facebook has faster promo cycles and rewards their top performing employees disproportionately.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="am-i-correct-to-interpret-that-you-started-at-grab-after-graduation-what-internships-did-you-do-during-your-studies">Am I correct to interpret that you started at Grab after graduation?

Regarding university internships, Year 2 I did CVWO, Year 3 NOC in Silicon Valley for EasilyDo (now called Edison), Year 4 I was a Game Producer (non-programmer!) in SUTD Game Lab (previously MIT Gambit program). Back during my time, overseas internships weren&#x27;t common.

Being at Facebook is fun because I get to do front end work which isn&#x27;t product, such as building React-based design systems, front end tooling, lint rules, CSS frameworks (Infima), Static site generators (Docusaurus).</p><p>Facebook is the leader in terms of front end web technologies. If you develop on the web, you would more likely than not, be using some of Facebook&#x27;s open source work, whether directly or not. There&#x27;s React, Flux, Jest, GraphQL, React Native, Docusaurus, Draft.js, Relay, Flow, just to name a few. By working at Facebook, I also got the chance to work on Docusaurus and for two years, led the development of Docusaurus v2, which is one of the projects I am most proud of in my career. Today, Docusaurus is powering most of Facebook&#x27;s open source websites. Many of the open source leaders I look up to were also at Facebook. I got to contribute to many high profile open source front end projects by Facebook and also work alongside the creator of React (Jordan Walke) on improving the front end of Facebook&#x27;s Ads Interfaces. Not to mention that Facebook employees will be the first to dogfood React&#x27;s new APIs and participate in design discussions and influence the future roadmap of React.</p><p>On the culture and working environment front, I have always vibed with Facebook&#x27;s hacker culture and products more than Google&#x27;s, so naturally I chose Facebook over Google even though their offers were comparable and I was given a chance to work on Google&#x27;s search results page.</p><p>Facebook is the best place for a Front End Engineer to grow and learn from the very best. So it was the most obvious choice for me and I&#x27;m glad I made that decision. It&#x27;s the best place I&#x27;ve worked at thus far (almost 4 years!) and also financially a great choice.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="could-i-ask-about-your-personal-experiences-at-fb-in-terms-of-learning-opportunities-and-the-work-you-do-">Could I ask about your personal experiences at FB in terms of learning opportunities and the work you do? :)<a class="hash-link" href="#could-i-ask-about-your-personal-experiences-at-fb-in-terms-of-learning-opportunities-and-the-work-you-do-" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The learning opportunities depend on many factors - individual preferences, team, projects, luck. Facebook is such a large company that covers virtually almost every domain of technology one can be interested in. With great internal mobility, it isn&#x27;t hard to find a project that one will be passionate about. The benefits (and also downsides) of working at such a large company is that you often have to think about scalability in your work. How do you scale your work to the tens of thousands of engineers using your libraries or the billions of users using your product?</p><p>Facebook is also a company which takes the growth of employees very seriously. We have clear levels and expectations for engineers, supportive managers who really care about the growth of their team, mentorship programs available for anyone who wants to grow in a particular area. One of a manager&#x27;s core responsibilities is to grow their team and employees, and they are being evaluated on that, so you can be sure that they treat it seriously. We have weekly 1:1s with managers and with our leads. Personally I&#x27;m mentoring around 3-4 junior engineers and helping them to grow into senior engineers in both their technical and organizational skills.</p><p>I&#x27;ve answered about my work above.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-made-you-and-the-team-came-up-with-the-idea-of-nusmods-and-nuswhispers-i-think-its-really-great-to-code-for-good-and-fulfilling-stuff-rather-than-coding-for-corporate-means">What made you and the team came up with the idea of NUSMods and NUSWhispers?

Joining NUSMods was one of the best decisions in my life, as impacted the lives of so many students (I daresay above 100k), learnt so much from working on it (it&#x27;s a relatively complex web application), and it helped me grow my network of like-minded individuals. <strong>We need more people to contribute so that the project can live on.</strong> Notice that the NUSMods core team (and alumni) have pretty zai backgrounds? Correlation or causation? Maybe both.</p><p>I came up with the idea for NUSWhispers but I didn&#x27;t write much code for it. I was tutor for a web development course (CP3101B) back in 2015 and I proposed that idea to some students. I&#x27;m glad they did a darn good job of it. Back then I wanted to create a platform that could connect and help students around the school and the idea of an anonymous platform/page sounded like fun.</p><p>I like building stuff that people use, and after graduation I try to open source my stuff.

Maybe not as much as quant trading firms, but if you also factor in other stuff like interesting work, social impact, then to me FB still comes up on top.</li><li>Bottom-up culture. In some companies, engineers are treated like mindless drones and expected to just execute. But not at FB. At FB, engineers are expected to do a fair bit of product and project management, propose ideas and lead the roadmap for their team, especially if their team&#x27;s product is a highly technical one. We have lots of flexibility and autonomy to manage our own work and what we want to do with our time.

We set goals for the half and then we&#x27;re pretty much running the project each on our own. On a day-to-day basis, I spent about half my time writing code and the other half reviewing code and attending meetings.

Back in school, I never really had an official CCA - I chose to do tutoring, work on open source stuff like NUSMods, and working as a boarding councillor at NUS High (sort of like RA but for NUS High Students), which gave me free accommodation near school). I liked the balance and diversity of the activities I had.</p><p>My CAP isn&#x27;t that high - got first class but not near 5.00. I reckon I could get A+ for every module if I really spent all my time studying, but studying isn&#x27;t exactly my favorite activity to do. I got my As usually from modules which were project-heavy. I value and enjoy the hands on experience more than the mugging experience.</p><p>I&#x27;m very lucky that Software Engineering exists so that there&#x27;s something meaningful which I can spend my time on, I enjoy doing, and also pays the bills.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="i-want-to-learn-as-much-as-possible-from-you-about-topics-that-might-benefit-me-as-im-graduating-next-year">I want to learn as much as possible from you about topics that might benefit me as I&#x27;m graduating next year.<a class="hash-link" href="#i-want-to-learn-as-much-as-possible-from-you-about-topics-that-might-benefit-me-as-im-graduating-next-year" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>DSA.
