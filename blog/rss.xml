            <description><![CDATA[I survived CS3216 and it wasn't an easy feat in my opinion, given that I spent almost half my time on CS1010S this semester, the other half went to CS3216. Would like to give a quick run-down of my experience in CS3216, something like a review. Oh yes by the way, the current module review site sucks, someone build a better one please.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Open source projects have always fascinated me. I personally find it tough to work effectively in small teams, working with a large community in a public, collaborative manner will makes things unimaginably tougher. However, with good management techniques, effective communication and efficient workflows, the open source community have succeeded and produced excellent technologies such as Ubuntu, Android, Rails, Django, Bootstrap, AngularJS, just to name a few. These projects have had great impact on technology and are widely used by developers in the course of their work. Android, with Google's backing, has become the world most popular smartphone OS. I personally use many open source JavaScript projects such as AngularJS and Node.js for my own development.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[I love attending last lectures for some weird reason. It is usually during the last lectures when the profs share their life experiences and wisdom; stuff that cannot be obtained from lecture notes or the internet. This week, I had the honor of attending two last lectures, the modules CS3216 and CS1010S by Dr Colin Tan and Prof Ben Leong respectively. The semester has almost come to a close and it can be summarized with two modules - Yes, you guessed it, CS3216 and CS1010S. I literally neglected all other modules this semester and only did the bare minimum required for the looming deadlines. Not really a trait of a good student, but who gives? I know my limits and I do what I like.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Team dynamics has always been a sticky issue to deal with. One of my key goals of joining CS3216 was to learn how to work with talented people from different disciplines. I enjoy working with my Assignment 1 group (Chun Mun, Viet Tien and Soedarsono) a lot. There's nobody playing the clear role of the leader because we are all leaders in our own areas of expertise. We make important decisions together and leave each other to work on the fine details. Because of our pretty diverse skillsets, when someone faces difficulty in their work, another will be able to step in to help resolve the issue. It is awesome. (:]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Ahh the Apple Maps app. What an uproar it caused when it was first released. Like many iPhone users, I don't use the Apple Maps app; I use the Google Maps app instead, simply because it syncs with the location queries that I make in my MacBook's Chrome browser. The Google Maps app has amazing user experience compared to Apple's version. Makes me wonder if Apple even tested their app with real users before putting it in every iPhone that runs iOS 6 and above.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[My team has decided to use Sails.js for the first assignment. It is an MVC framework for Node.js that is pretty much like rails. It's time to learn a new framework/library again! And sadly, because it's a new framework, there isn't much documentation and tutorials for me to refer to. I learn best through doing and experimenting. As the saying goes: I see and I understand, I do and I remember. Getting my hands dirty and trying things out for myself is an important phase of learning something new.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA["What exactly do I want to build in CS3216?". This question has been bugging me for the entire summer and I still do not have an answer to this question. Initially, I wanted to build a multiplayer game that uses WebRTC because it has been really hot after Google demonstrated prototypes of their WebRTC games during Google I/O, such as Chrome Maze, Cube Slam and Racer. Most people will shy away from building games simply because it's tough to produce the assets for the game. However, with a background in design, and because I have experience in building an iPad game Tenza Yakitori as the final project of CS3217, I felt that I could build a game for a project and it will still turn out decent. Also, I was getting bored of building CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) apps; game logic was definitely more fun to code.]]></description>
