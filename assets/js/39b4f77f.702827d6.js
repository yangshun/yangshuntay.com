As the code that we have written is open to public scrutiny, it is extremely fulfilling when our code is accepted and deemed to have met the standards of the community. In this sense, working on an Open Source project definitely beats working on school projects, where the main emphasis is often to simply make the code work, and there is little emphasis on the quality of the code."),(0,a.kt)("p",null,"We became familiar with common open source workflows, making frequent use of Git features such as branching, rebasing, cherry picking, reset, etc, and saw a significant improvement in our Git-fu. Some of us had teammates who were unfamiliar with Git and we were frequently helping them clean up their pull requests and teaching them the proper Git workflow for the project. We saw that as a personal achievement because at the start of the program, we were only familiar with the common Git commands, but at the end of it, we are able to understand and execute complicated Git workflows. We have also come to appreciate Github as a well-designed platform that aids in the development of open source projects."),(0,a.kt)("p",null,"A main challenge that we faced was having to work with teammates who were in different locations and time zones. We were used to working with teammates who were physically present (such as during school projects or on an internship), and never had the chance to work in remote teams. In our projects, we found that the communication overhead often reduced the momentum of our projects considerably. This is especially evident for the code reviews of pull requests: it would often take days before a pull request was thoroughly reviewed and merged."),(0,a.kt)("p",null,"We felt that we could probably have been more effective if we were more aware on how our actions would have affected our teammates. Upon reflection, there were times where our actions might have made some of the work done by our teammates obsolete, usually by implementing features that supersede what they have done or causing their work to be irrelevant. We should have been more aware of this, and probably clarified our intentions with each other, as well as worked more closely to resolve issues."),(0,a.kt)("p",null,"We have also been able to apply some of the ideas that we have learnt into our school projects.

It is only natural that we should give back and contribute to the growth of open source projects. The Facebook Open Academy program has provided us with the opportunity to take the first step in contributing to Open Source, under the guidance and supervision of capable project mentors.
