Ironically, many of the skills that required for me to succeed in my internship were not taught in school. We were not taught to maintain development and production environments; neither were we taught to work with coworkers from other departments. These are also skills beyond school context that are valued in the industry, hence it is important that we learn them. CS3216 is special in the sense that it accepts students from all faculties as long as they have the relevant interests. I launched Corspedia together with a friend, Weiqing Toh, in late July. Corspedia is a search engine for CORS bidding history and takes the pain out of navigating the horrendous CORS bidding archives interface. It was popular among NUS students and we had 1000+ active visitors each day. For Corspedia, I was the designer and front end developer. Both me and my partner participated in the product design were actively discussing what features to add for the next release at the end of the year. I believe an important criteria to succeed is to learn to be versatile and take up many roles. I'm here to learn to wear multiple hats and get my hands dirty on things beyond coding.

It's weird but I enjoy writing HTML and Markdown syntax. I get a sense of satisfaction from seeing markup being transformed into rendered layouts and elements. It is also awesome to be able to create useful softwares that reaches the hands of people right from my personal laptop. But software is rarely the work of a single person. I enjoy working in small teams with trusted programmer friends to hack out something cool together. I used to enjoy hackathons, participating in almost every that I could while I was in Silicon Valley. I have grown to realize that my time was better spent working on longer-term side-projects, rather than small hackathon projects which would end up abandoned after the hackathon event.

That is because I started university majoring in Mechnical Engineering but I grew to love programming after taking a compulsory introduction to programming course in my first year (CS1010E). I found myself spending more time on coding than my mechanical engineering modules. I didn't really understand what I was studying in ME and I was familiarizing myself with question patterns rather than understanding the concepts in order to clear the exams. In the end, I took a gamble and applied to switch courses after Year 2 Sem 1. My results were decent enough and I had a recommendation from Dr Ang Chuan Heng whom I worked for while serving as a Teaching Assistant for CS1020E. In the end, I could switch course and even keep my NUS Faculty Scholarship. It was too good to be true.
