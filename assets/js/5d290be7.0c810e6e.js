Going up the levels is all about scope and complexity. IC3s (Junior Engineer) work on tasks, IC4s (Software Engineer) work on features, IC5s (Senior Software Engineer) work on projects, IC6s (Staff Software Engineer) work on huge projects spanning across teams, IC7s (Senior Staff Software Engineer) work on projects spanning across the org, IC8+s (Principal Software Engineer) work on projects spanning across the company or even influencing the industry. If you're able to show that you can handle scope of that magnitude, there shouldn't be a reason not to be compensated at that level. That said, the rough guide I proposed here is for a company the size of Facebook where we have 10s of thousands of Engineers. Doing work that impacts an entire company of 10 people likely won't be IC8 level work. For reference, React core team is mostly made up of IC5s/IC6s and one IC7. Flow has a number of IC5s and IC6s as it's technically complex and affects how the entire company writes JavaScript. GraphQL has many senior engineers and the creator of GraphQL is currently a director (IC8 equivalent)."),(0,a.kt)("h3",{id:"are-you-still-doing-a-lot-of-fe-related-development-work-now-be-it-in-the-company-or-personally-if-yes-i-am-just-curious-what-are-the-things-you-often-do-and-what-do-you-like-in-particular-about-fe-development"},"Are you still doing a lot of FE-related development work now?

At FB we build a lot of FE-related tooling (e.g. Jest, GraphQL, Flow) and libraries (our internal CSS-in-JS solution, Docusaurus, React, Flux, etc) which is personally very exciting to me. Even within front end development, there are various layers - very user-facing stuff (HTML/CSS/visual related code) and back end (JavaScript stuff, network layer, storage), tooling (ESLint, Babel, TypeScript, webpack). I call myself a full front end stack developer as I'm decent across the entire front end stack. I'm especially excited about tooling work as the problems there are interesting and challenging.
